## Financial Report - NextJS Application

The application connects to an api whose endpoints are **/api/banks** and **/api/expenses**, receives the data, generates the menus and tables dynamically, then calculates the balances of both endpoints, also you can see the transactions for each date and category, I also suggested a fun logo and the coolest liquid layout i can make in one day.

## Instructions:

- Run **npm install** to install the dependencies.
- Run **npm run dev** to start the development server.
- Open **http://localhost:3000** in the browser.
